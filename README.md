## Project Descriptions

1. **Brownian Motion:**
   - *Description:* This project explores the principles of Brownian motion, a mathematical model of random motion used in various fields, including finance. The project delves into the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Brownian motion in understanding stochastic processes.

2. **Modern Portfolio Theory:**
   - *Description:* Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is the focus of this project, which investigates the principles of constructing an investment portfolio to optimize returns while managing risk. The project explores the key concepts of asset allocation, diversification, and risk-adjusted returns within the framework of MPT.

3. **Pricing Derivatives:**
   - *Description:* This project is dedicated to the intricate world of derivative pricing, examining the methods and models employed to evaluate the value of financial derivatives. Topics covered include options, futures, and other financial instruments, providing insights into the pricing mechanisms essential for effective risk management.

4. **Returns of an S&P Investment:**
   - *Description:* The project analyzes the historical and hypothetical returns of an investment in the S&P 500 index. It explores the factors influencing returns, including market trends and the power of compounding, offering a comprehensive view of the potential outcomes of investing in this benchmark index.

5. **Volatility Surface:**
   - *Description:* This project focuses on the volatility surface, a graphical representation of implied volatility values across various strike prices and expiration dates. Exploring the dynamics of the volatility surface provides insights into market expectations and is crucial for pricing and risk management in the options and derivatives markets.
